### Hi there 👋

I’m Charles, a frontend engineer and entrepreneur based in Berlin, Germany. I’m currently working at Metycle as a Frontend Engineer, supporting to build a ciruclar economy for metals. On the side I run ontour.pro, where we develop technologies that empower diy musicians to plan their tours.

Building is more than a passion 🪚 🛠 I love to build products that make a difference. I mix my experience as a developer with my 6 years of experience in business and marketing strategy to create the best experience for users. Always up for a good coffee to discuss new ideas ☕️

Don't hesitate to get in touch 💬 <br>
