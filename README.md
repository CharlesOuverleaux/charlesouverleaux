### Hi there 👋

Currently working for Metycle as Frontend Engineer in Germany.

Building is more than a passion 🪚 🛠 I love to build products that make a difference. I mix my experience as a developer with my 6 years of experience in business and marketing strategy to create the best experience for users. Always up for a good coffee to discuss new ideas ☕️
