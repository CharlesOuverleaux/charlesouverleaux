### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

After working 6 years in sales and marketing I decided to focus on the parts of my jobs I enjoyed the most: coding ğŸ’» and problem solving ğŸš€. Always eager to learn more, I changed career path and dived into programming. I'm combining my analytical mindset and understanding of ecommerce in my work as a developer.

Don't hesitate to get in touch ğŸ’¬
